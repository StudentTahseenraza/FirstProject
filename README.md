# Linkedin-Automation
LinkedIn Automation Tool Project Summary
Objective
The project aims to create a LinkedIn Automation Tool that allows users to send connection requests to multiple LinkedIn profiles automatically. It includes features such as error handling, progress tracking, scheduling, and message customization.

How It Works
User Input:

Users enter LinkedIn profile URLs, a custom message, and optionally a schedule time in the form.
The Start Automation button triggers the process.
Validation and Scheduling:

The script validates the URLs and checks if the scheduling time is valid.
If a future schedule time is provided, the script waits until the specified time to start the automation.
Automation Process:

The script processes each URL, simulates sending a connection request with the custom message, and updates the progress bar accordingly.
The status message updates to reflect the progress and completion of the automation.
This LinkedIn Automation Tool provides a foundation for automating LinkedIn connection requests with additional features for user convenience and better user experience. In a real-world application, this would involve more robust handling of LinkedIn API interactions and compliance with LinkedInâ€™s terms of service.
